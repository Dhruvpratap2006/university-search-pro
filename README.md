🎓 University Search Tool (API Archive)
A streamlined web application designed to fetch and display university data globally. This project demonstrates the practical application of Asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and Dynamic DOM manipulation.

📌 Project Overview
This tool allows users to enter a country name and instantly retrieve a list of universities registered in that region. It specifically handles regional data (State/Province) to provide a detailed view of each institution.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (including Google Fonts integration)

Logic: JavaScript (ES6+)

Networking: Axios (Promise-based HTTP client)

API: HipoLabs University Domains and Research API

🚀 Key Features
Async/Await Logic: Ensures a smooth, non-blocking user experience during data fetching.

Dynamic UI Updates: Results are injected into the DOM in real-time.

Data Validation: Specifically checks for state-province fields to ensure regional data is displayed only when available.

Error Handling: Includes try/catch blocks to manage API downtime or network issues gracefully.

📖 How to Use
Enter a country name (e.g., "India", "United States", "Canada") into the search field.

Click the Search (or Execute) button.

View the list of colleges populated with their respective "Case Numbers" and regional locations.
